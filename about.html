        <h2>The Fashion Pet Team</h2>
        <p class="care">It all started with a needy Newfoundland puppy. The grooming needs were more than the owner could handle on their own. Recognizing a community need for full service dog care, The Fashion Pet was born. Now proud owners of sixteen dogs of all different breeds we know how to care for your pet's grooming needs. Our happy helpful team will pamper your pet while you are free to carry on with your day.</p>
